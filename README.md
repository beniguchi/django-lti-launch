# Django LTI Launch App

This repository contains a reusable Django app named `ltilaunch` to manage user authorization via LTI 1.x.
It also contains a test Django project `django_lti_launch` to use for development and as a basic example of usage.


## Installation

The development branch can be installed via `pip`:

```
$ pip install git+ssh://github.com/unizin/django-lti-launch
```


## Requirements

The `ltilaunch` app currently only works with the `postgresql_psycopg2` database backend.
It requires at least PostgreSQL 9.4 and at least Psycopg2 2.5.4.
See the [Postgres specific model fields](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/) section of the Django documentation for more information.


## Configuration

In order to use the LTI launch functionality, you must add the `ltilaunch` app to your `settings.py` file:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'ltilaunch',
    # ...
]
```

The app also installs an authentication backend to validate signed LTI launch requests.
This authentication backend depends on the standard Django user model, so both backends must be present in `settings.py`:

```
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'ltilaunch.auth.LTILaunchBackend',
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend'],
    # ...
]
```

To create the tables necessary to track LTI logins, run `manage.py migrate ltilaunch` after making changes to your project settings.


## How to Use

[IMS Global LTI](https://www.imsglobal.org/specs/ltiv1p2/implementation-guide) specifies an authentication mechanism that relies on an out-of-band shared key and secret between a tool consumer and a tool provider.
This app provides a mechanism to manage this credential exchange in the Django admin site.

Before any LTI launch will succeed, you must create at least one `LTIToolConsumer` model object. This represents an external system that will use the LTI tool provided by your Django project.
This app's Django admin site form for LTI consumers will generate an `oauth_consumer_key` and `oauth_consumer_secret` value that must be shared with the LTI tool consumer's administrator.
You can optionally specify a `tool_consumer_instance_guid` value that the LTI tool consumer's administrator should be able to give to you.
Combined with selecting the _Match GUID and OAuth consumer_ option in the Django admin form, this value minimizes the potential impact of accidental OAuth credential misconfigurationâ€”for example, a testing LMS instance won't be able to corrupt data for a production LMS instance by using the same key and secret.

There are two views provided to handle LTI launch and return: `LaunchView` and `ReturnRedirectView`.  Configure these in your project's `urls.py` to provide one or more endpoints where tool consumers will send their authentication information to begin a new session.  You will likely want to override the `LaunchView.tool_provider_url` field to point to the correct landing page for your project.

```
urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    url(r'^launch', LaunchView.as_view(tool_provider_url='/tool')),
    # ...
]
```

In the above example, the tool provider administrator would configure the `/launch` URL on your server as the launch URL, and your tool's user interface would be delivered at `/tool`.

You could support multiple tools easily by doing something like the following:

```
urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    url(r'^launchcharts', LaunchView.as_view(tool_provider_url='/charts')),
    url(r'^launchlor', LaunchView.as_view(tool_provider_url='/learningobjects))
    # ...
]
```

An optional feature provided by `ltilaunch` is the `ConfigView`, which will render a public XML configuration file for use by tool provider administrators.
The `ConfigView` requires an `LTIToolProvider` model object to be created for each configuration; this can be done in the Django admin site.
In the example above, you would likely want to configure one tool provider with `launch_path='/charts'` and another with `launch_path='/learningobjects'`.
If you named the "charts" tool `charts` in the `LTIToolProvider` model, the XML configuration would then be available at `/ltilaunch/config/charts/`.

The LTI launch information is available to your project via the `LTIUser` model objects.
A typical examination of launch parameters in a view looks like this:

```
lti_user_pk = self.request.session[ltilaunch.LTIUSER_SESSION_KEY]
launch_data = LTIUser.objects.get(pk=lti_user_pk).last_launch_parameters
```

The `launch_data` object will be a dict containing the [request parameters](https://www.imsglobal.org/specs/ltiv1p2/implementation-guide#toc-3) of the LTI launch.
In the above example, the `LTIUser` is looked up using a session value set by `LaunchView`.


## Cross-Consumer User Matching
The `LTIToolConsumer` model should have a one-to-one correspondence with `oauth_consumer_key` and `tool_consumer_instance_guid` values.
However, in many real-world cases, it is preferable for a group of LTI tool consumers to be treated as a single tenant.
Some examples include multiple production LMSes running simultaneously at a site, or separate environments for testing and production.
In these cases, we would like to use a single Django user object to correspond to a single _person_, while still being able to use multiple `LTIUser` objects to manage that person's activities within multiple _LTI consumers_.

The ability to match launches from different consumers to a single Django `User` is provided by the following optional constructs.

1. A model `LTIToolConsumerGroup` that can be managed through the Django admin UI.
When multiple `LTIToolConsumer` objects have the same `consumer_group` value, the user matching code is constrained to those objects.
If an `LTIToolConsumer` has no value for `consumer_group`, then user matching code is only applied to that single consumer.
2. An `LTIUserMatcher` type that can be specified as an absolute class name (for example `ltilaunch.usermatch.LTIUserMatcher`) in the Django admin UI for a tool consumer.
The intent is for projects that use `ltilaunch` to provide their own custom subclasses of `LTIUserMatcher` that implement the correct logic for their particular use case.
The `ltilaunch.usermatch` module contains the base class (which matches the standard LTI user ID across all consumers in a tool consumer group) and a `CanvasCustomUserMatcher` subclass which implements some logic based on real-world scenarios with Canvas.

To provide your own user matcher class, subclass `ltilaunch.usermatch.LTIUserMatcher` in your own project code, and override the `users_for_launch` method.
The `lti_users` parameter passed to this method will already be constrained to the tool consumer or tool consumer group.
The overridden method should return a queryset containing any users that match based on your site-specific requirements.
Since we used the PostgreSQL-specific `JSONField` type, all of the values in `last_launch_parameters` can be efficiently queried with Django's filter syntax.

After completing this custom user matcher (let's call it `myapp.CustomLTIMatcher`), all that needs to be done is to enter the string `myapp.CustomLTIMatcher` in the **Matcher class name** field of the LTI consumer admin form.


## Development Environment Setup

These steps are only needed if you wish to work with the `ltilaunch` app in the context of the testing-only `django_lti_launch` project.

```
$ vagrant up
$ ./dev_scripts/remote_manage.sh migrate
$ ./dev_scripts/remote_manage.sh createsuperuser --username admin
```

Enter whatever you like for the superuser credentials.  Then:

```
$ ./dev_scripts/remote_manage.sh runsslserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

The SSL devserver is used here to make it easy to use the Canvas LTI self-guided learning module without installing or managing extra web server software.  Production deploys should naturally use the Apache, nginx, ELB, or other frontend to provide SSL.

You should be able to access the Django admin UI at https://localhost:8000/admin/.  If this doesn't work, check that Vagrant did not assign a different port due to a collision with an existing service on the host machine.
